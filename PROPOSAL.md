# [Wach-A-Tile]

### Author: [Ashwini Sarvepalli]

#### What kind of project do you want to create
I want to create an app that it like piano tiles and wach a mole. Where tiles would appear on screen in random locations and the player would have to click on these tiles to get points. The tiles would show up on screen in accordance to the bpm of the song.

#### What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project?
I've always enjoyed touching games, it was a fun way to test reflexes and easily compete with others. And because it is a game I will be motivated to finish the game so I could play the game. I also have played many piano-based games such as smule, and it always adds more when you can listen to a whole song by clicking different tiles. I have created clicking button games before, so this is similar along that line, and with snake, I have experience with audio, so using SoundPlayer shouldn't be too different.

#### What specific external libraries will you need? Provide some links
I have used the SQLiteModernCpp + SQLite3 library in order to keep track of a leaderboard and gflags for program command arguments.

#### A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")
By Week 1 I should have set up my external libraries and created a database for the leaderboard and made sure it was created properly and also check that my gflags work properly.
By Week 2 I should have finished the basic functionality of the app. Meaning, the tiles are able to pop up in random locations. The tiles are also touch-sensitive and the score was being stored. I should have also completed the the playing game and the game over screens. So the game over screen prints form the leaderboard accordingly
By Week 3 I should have cleaned up my logic and code making it as efficient as possible and make sure everything works with no bugs.

#### If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?
potentially guide it more in the piano tiles route, and have a moving screen with predestined locations with a song being played, or adding more different songs and more UI. Even potentially making the tiles move around the screen rather than popping up in one spot and disappearing.
