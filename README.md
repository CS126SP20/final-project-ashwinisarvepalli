## Wach-A-Tile

### Author: [Ashwini Sarvepalli]

#### What is this project
In accordance to the beat of a song with different bpm levels, tile will show up on screen in relation to the beats of the song. Players then have to click the tile, and are able to click it multiple times in one spot if they choose to do so but must be wary of the change of position. If the use clicks on an empty space where there is no tiel, the game will end. The game will also finish once the player plays through the whole song.

#### How to run the project


#### What external libraries used 
I have used the SQLiteModernCpp + SQLite3 library in order to keep track of a leaderboard and gflags for program command arguments.
